</h2>
<h6> Co-Created With Alexandre Charette
</h6>

The Goal of this project was to create a looping narrative experience by using Processing.
At the time of the project, my partner and I were not familiar with Git or other sharing tools and so our approach to the entire project had to be very modular.

For my part, I was tasked with the project's functionality and flow. I ensured that every sequence was able to start and stop properly without bleeding into the next, in addition to the bulk programming of the interactive elements.

The project was successful and the piece can run indefinitely as if every loop was the first. However, the music used does eventually end and start again with some disruption.
