  </h2>
  <h6> Co-Created With Alexandre Charette  </h6>

  <p>
  The Goal of this project was to create a looping narrative experience by using Processing.
  At the time of the project, my partner and I were not familiar with Git or other sharing tools and so our approach to the entire project had to be very modular.
</p>
<p>
  For my part, I was tasked with the project's functionality and flow. I ensured that every sequence was able to start and stop properly without bleeding into the next, in addition to the bulk programming of the interactive elements.
</p>
<p>
  The project was successful and the piece can run indefinitely as if every loop was the first. However, the music used does eventually end and start again with some disruption.
