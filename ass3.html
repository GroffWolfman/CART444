  <h3>biographical statement of 100-150 words.</h3>
<p>
  I am a creative problem solver. Having worked and studied in outside-of-the-box fields, I am capable of adapting to new situations and overcoming them. My years of working with enterprise-level software has given me an understanding of how to translate high concept requirements down into actionable tasks, while also being able to coordinate individuals based on their abilities.

  I consider myself to be a multidisciplinary creative. I write both technically and creatively. I have created physical and digital renderings and dioramas. I thrive in statistics driven environments as data visualisation is one of my areas of interest. I’ve experimented with generative art to attempt to combine my interests.

  Duncan Rhodes is a miniature painter and content creator from the UK. He has gained a following in recent years for the qualities of his tutorials and his painting. Recently, he left his former studio and chose to found his own painting school, with both online and in-person classes and tutorials.

  <p>I believe he is worth emulating because he is visibly passionate about his work, while also being able to convey his methods in a friendly and confident way. While being very skilled, he was able to take his interest and passion to the next level and not only promote it but monetize it as well, with the support of not only his fans but his peers as well.
  </p>
<p>He also has great complimentary skills, such as photography and editing (both video and still), which bolster his core works, thereby making his catalogue seem more impressive.
