  <h3>biographical statement of 100-150 words.</h3>
<p>
  I am a creative problem solver. Having worked and studied in outside-of-the-box fields, I am capable of adapting to new situations and overcoming them. My years of working with enterprise-level software has given me an understanding of how to translate high concept requirements down into actionable tasks, while also being able to coordinate individuals based on their abilities.

  I consider myself to be a multidisciplinary creative. I write both technically and creatively. I have created physical and digital renderings and dioramas. I thrive in statistics driven environments as data visualisation is one of my areas of interest. I’ve experimented with generative art to attempt to combine my interests.
