<p>
HeartBleed's goal was to inform others about the, at the time recent, breach of security, known as the heartbleed bug.
<p/>
<p>This was an independent project I undertook as a blind attempt at game design. All Assets and Programming were done by me using the GameMaker Studio suite in it's own language (GML) which has some resemblance to C#.
</p>
<p>
As this was a ground-up build, there were a lot of challenges and a lot of learning. Everything about the game's creation was done by following tutorials with no prior experience.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, as the free version of GameMaker was being used, some creative work arounds had to be found in order to get around the engine's asset limits. Had this been done differently, there would have been more independence in assets with more room for minor animations and other style choices.
