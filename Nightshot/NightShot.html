  NightShot (or Night.Shot) is a spin on the puzzle subgenre of "Match Three" or Brick Breaker games.
  At it's base, the concept is the same, destroy the items on the screen by matching Three or more of the same coloured objects together. The twist on the traditional game is that the objects are shot automatically, instead the player must move and angle the launcher in order to line up the shots and destroy the bordering balls.
</p>
  During development, several design challenges came up. But many were rooted in the problem that there was no incentive to move around the board. This was solved in two ways, first, contact with any ball results in a Game Over state. Second, The win condition was set to be to remove a number of the <b>originally spawned</b> balls from the level. These two conditions meant that staying still would eventually narrow the play space, which would result in death, staying still would also make it harder to reach some of the required balls later in the level.
<p>
  The bright colouration, music and visuals were intended to evoke a synthwave or outrun theme.
  Overall the project was a success and remains one of the more challenging but satisfying games I've made.
