<p>
The SelfScape started out as an untitled project without a reason. Originally this was to be a simulation mapping the moods and 'commutes' of the agents, with the intention of demonstrating how interactions with others can affect one's mood during the day and how the home and work lives of agents. But as I worked on it, I began to influence it without realizing it.

I was going through a rough patch while working on this project, the longer I worked on it, the more I was forcing the agents into a negative mood trend. One that would become increasingly difficult to break out of.

At a certain point, in the final stretch before the original project deadline, I found myself in a slightly better place overall, and realized I was also imposing that onto the agents in the simulation. It wasn't until I looked at my git history that I realized I had been projecting onto the project for over a month. In a way, the code for the simulation is only a part of the project, the git history, code comments and even presentation are all part of what this project was in totality.
