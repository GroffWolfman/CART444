3D Diorama

<p>The Instruction for this project was fairly simple. Create a Diorama using only Blender.
</p>

<p>What I did not expect going in, was the amount of time I would end up tinkering with the lighting on the project. Once everything was in place, the hardest part was achieving a middle of the night style glow, and the implication of a door and space outside the diorama.
</p>
<p>
The project was a technical success in the end as a diorama had been created in a way that I was content with. However, in terms of theming and messaging, the project was a bit of a failure. When shown without context, the initial reaction is that the piece is "creepy" or "scary" when the desired theme was playful and possibly funny.
