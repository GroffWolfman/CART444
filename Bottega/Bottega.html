  Bottega has been a multiple year effort. Originally this was a project focused on the assisted creation of a unique art piece. A user, who is a human person, would go through the start up and select their group of workers (sometimes referred to as Agents), which are very limited AI. The workers would then be released into the factory and work for the duration of their shift, adding their elements to the canvas, once all agents had finished working, the canvas would be captured and saved to the computer.

  This was revisited a few years later, with a slightly different take. The assets used for art creation would need to be improved in quality and compatibility, and the end result would need to be more interesting.
</p>
<p>
  The revamp featured 'collections' which were curated by the factory space itself, the program collected the images and sorted them into their own uniquely named folder. As well as a some code to manage colour palette, to create more coherent images compared to the original iteration.

  The final, and yet unrealized, step of this project will be to have these computer generated images be printed into reality as part of their collections.
